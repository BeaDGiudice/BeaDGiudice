- 👋 Hi, I’m @BeaDGiudice
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end and graphic design.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning english and I will learn french and spanish.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate right now, I'm just looking for more knowledge about tecnology, after all I'm finishing my last year of high school.
